# PhD_Study1

This repository provides the R code and datafile for the first study of my PhD, a multilevel meta-analysis of the associations between burnout and a number of health variables (anxiety, depression, physical symptoms, satisfaction, vitality). 

The code follows Gucciardi and colleagues' paper on multilevel meta-analyses, available here: https://doi.org/10.1080/1750984X.2021.1946835

The datafile is based on a systematic review connected to the meta-analyses, the paper (Glandorf et al., 2023) is available here: https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1080/1750984X.2023.2225187
